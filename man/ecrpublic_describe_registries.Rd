\title{Returns details for a public registry}
\usage{
ecrpublic_describe_registries(nextToken = NULL, maxResults = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value that's returned from a previous paginated
\code{\link[=ecrpublic_describe_registries]{describe_registries}} request where
\code{maxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value of that
parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results
that returned the \code{nextToken} value. If there are no more results to
return, this value is \code{null}.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used
to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic
purposes.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of repository results that's returned by
\code{\link[=ecrpublic_describe_registries]{describe_registries}} in paginated
output. When this parameter is used,
\code{\link[=ecrpublic_describe_registries]{describe_registries}} only returns
\code{maxResults} results in a single page along with a \code{nextToken} response
element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by
sending another \code{\link[=ecrpublic_describe_registries]{describe_registries}}
request with the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 1
and 1000. If this parameter isn't used, then
\code{\link[=ecrpublic_describe_registries]{describe_registries}} returns up to 100
results and a \code{nextToken} value, if applicable.}
