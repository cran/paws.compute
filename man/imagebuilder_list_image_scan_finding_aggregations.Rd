\description{
Returns a list of image scan aggregations for your account. You can filter by the type of key that Image Builder uses to group results. For example, if you want to get a list of findings by severity level for one of your pipelines, you might specify your pipeline with the \code{imagePipelineArn} filter. If you don't specify a filter, Image Builder returns an aggregation for your account.
