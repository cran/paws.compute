}
\arguments{
\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of cluster results returned by
ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions in paginated output. When you use this
parameter, ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions returns only maxResults results
in a single page along with a nextToken response element. You can see
the remaining results of the initial request by sending another
ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions request with the returned nextToken value.
This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter,
ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions returns up to 10 results and a nextToken
value if applicable.}

\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value returned from a previous paginated
\code{\link[=eks_list_eks_anywhere_subscriptions]{list_eks_anywhere_subscriptions}}
request where \code{maxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value
of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous
results that returned the \code{nextToken} value.}

\item{includeStatus}{An array of subscription statuses to filter on.}
